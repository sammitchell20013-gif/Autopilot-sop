## 🚀 What Should You Do Next?

### **Option 1: Build Video Upload (Recommended! 🔥)**

**Why:** This is the CORE feature - users need to upload videos!

**What I'll Build:**

- Show uploaded videos

**How Long:** 30 minutes

**Tell me:** "Let's build video upload!"

---

### **Option 2: Deploy to Production**

**Why:** Show the world what you built!

**What I'll Do:**
- Update Netlify with new code
- Set up environment variables
- Deploy your app live
- Give you a public URL

**How Long:** 10 minutes

**Tell me:** "Deploy this to Netlify!"

---

### **Option 3: Add OpenAI (The Magic!)**

**Why:** This makes your app actually generate SOPs from videos

**What You Need:**
- OpenAI API key ($5-20/month)
- Video transcription setup
- AI step generation

**How Long:** 1-2 hours

**Tell me:** "Let's add AI processing!"

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Do Option 1: Build Video Upload**

Why?
1. Quick to build (30 min)
2. Core feature of your app
3. Makes it feel "real"
4. Fun to test!
5. Then you can deploy!

After that:
1. Deploy to Netlify (show friends!)
2. Add AI (the magic part)
3. Polish editor (make it pretty)
